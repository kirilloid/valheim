# Valheim tools

## Common use

This is an integrated knowledgebase / calculators for the [Valheim game](https://www.valheimgame.com/).

If you want to see this project in action, go to valheim.kirilloid.ru

## Developers

If you're looking for the object database, which is convenient to use for developers, go to the project site: valheim.kirilloid.ru open browser DevTools / JavaScript console, and inspect content of an `objectDB` global variable. "Schema" could be found in `types.ts`

I do not change the data structure every month, but compatibility between project updates is still not guaranteed.
